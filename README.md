## About

I created this for a friend who wanted to learn how to use `Python3` to access
REST APIs.

This tutorial goes over how to use urllib and requests to accomplish the same
task.

It doesn't go over every feature of the libraries, and it won't answer every
question. But this wasn't meant to. It was simply a small tutorial on how to use
the libraries to `GET` data from a REST API.
